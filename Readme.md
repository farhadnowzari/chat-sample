# Chat Sample Project

Chat Sample Project provides a simple functioning video streaming app.

For the server side it is using `Scala WebSockets` for announding the new users join and rooms management. For the p2p connection it is using `peerjs` which is a nodejs server side project and a client side package is also availbale for it to establish secure connections (peerjs is a third party library and I'm not a contributer for it).


This project is hosted on Microsoft Azure with a free plan account.

The backend is deployed using the DocketInstances.

The frontend is deployed as vuejs static website.


**NOTE:** This project is not tested on iOS
